This is a **neural network training model** of tic tac toe with 27 nodes vs the **minimax algoritm**

This is only for entertainment purpose since I want to see with neural network training can it ever manage to get a win and how long does the training takes for it actually beginning to tie

No training:
- wins:0
- loses: 14
- ties: 0

After 12 hours of training:
- wins:15
- loses: 0
- ties: 0
